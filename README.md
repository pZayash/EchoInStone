# EchoInStone

**EchoInStone** is a comprehensive audio processing tool designed to transcribe, diarize, and align speaker segments from audio files with a focus on achieving the most accurate and faithful transcription possible. It supports various audio sources, including YouTube videos and podcasts, and provides a flexible pipeline for processing audio data, prioritizing precision and reliability over speed.

## Features

- **Transcription**: Convert audio files into text using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, `Whisper Large v3 Turbo`.
- **Diarization**: Identify and separate different speakers in an audio file with the cutting-edge model, `Pyannote Speaker Diarization 3.1`.
- **Alignment**: Align transcribed text with the corresponding audio segments using a customized algorithm tailored to be highly efficient and faithful to the outputs of Whisper and Pyannote, `SpeakerAlignement`.
- **Flexible and Extensible Pipeline**: Easily integrate new models or processing steps into an orchestrated pipeline, `AudioProcessingOrchestrator`.

> Note: The current version of EchoInStone is a preliminary release. Future updates will include more flexible configuration options and enhanced functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (dependency management tool)
- ffmpeg (required for audio processing)

> Note: `ffmpeg` must be installed and available in your system's PATH.  
> You can install it via your package manager:
> - On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
> - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
> - On Windows: Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeanjerome/EchoInStone.git
   cd EchoInStone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using Poetry**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
    ```

 
 **zayash: To use intel arc xpu**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pip3 install torch==2.7.0+xpu torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
   ```

3. **Configure logging** (optional):
   - The logging configuration is set up to output logs to both the console and a file (`app.log`). You can modify the logging settings in `logging_config.py`.

4. **Configure Hugging Face Token**:

  - Add your Hugging Face token to this file. You can obtain a token by following these steps:
     1. Go to [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
     2. Click on "New token".
     3. Copy the generated token and paste it into the `EchoInStone/config.py` file as shown below:

```python
# EchoInStone/config.py

# Hugging Face authentication token
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

To transcribe and diarize a YouTube video, you can run the following command:

```bash
poetry run python main.py <audio_input_url>
```

- `<audio_input_url>`: The URL of the audio input (YouTube, podcast, or direct audio file).

### Command-Line Arguments

- **`--output_dir`**: Directory to save the output files. Default is `"results"`.
  ```bash
  poetry run python main.py <audio_input_url> --output_dir <output_directory>
  ```

- **`--transcription_output`**: Filename for the transcription output. Default is `"speaker_transcriptions.json"`.
  ```bash
  poetry run python main.py <audio_input_url> --transcription_output <output_filename>
  ```

### Examples

- **Transcribe and diarize a YouTube video**:
  ```bash
  poetry run python main.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plZRCMx_Jd8"
  ```

- **Transcribe and diarize a podcast**:
  ```bash
  poetry run python main.py "https://radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/rss_13957.xml"
  ```

- **Transcribe and diarize a direct MP3 file**:
  ```bash
  poetry run python main.py "https://media.radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/25425-13.02.2025-ITEMA_24028677-2025C53905E0006-NET_MFC_D378B90D-D570-44E9-AB5A-F0CC63B05A14-21.mp3"
  ```

## Testing

EchoInStone includes comprehensive test coverage with both unit tests and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

### Run All Tests

To run all tests (unit tests and BDD tests):
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ features/ -v
```

### Run Tests by Type

**Unit Tests Only** (technical implementation tests):
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

**BDD Tests Only** (behavioral scenarios):
```bash
poetry run pytest features/ -v
```

### Test Coverage

To generate a coverage report:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ features/ --cov=EchoInStone --cov-report html
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `htmlcov/` directory.

### Test Structure

- **`tests/`**: Unit tests that verify individual components and functions
  - `test_audio_downloader.py`: Tests for URL/file downloading functionality
  - `test_downloader_factory.py`: Tests for downloader selection logic
  - `test_integration.py`: Integration tests for complete workflows

- **`features/`**: BDD tests that describe user-facing behavior
  - `downloader.feature`: Downloader selection scenarios
  - `audio_download.feature`: Audio download functionality scenarios
  - `successful_download.feature`: Download success scenarios
  - `invalid_url.feature`: Error handling scenarios
  - `transcription_output.feature`: Transcription output validation

### Test Examples

The test suite covers various scenarios including:
- YouTube video downloads
- Podcast RSS feed processing
- Direct MP3/audio file URLs (including RFI radio content)
- Local file processing
- Network error handling
- Header authentication for restricted URLs

All tests are designed to prevent regressions and ensure that the audio download functionality works correctly across different input types.

## Configuration

### Logging

Logging is configured to output messages to both the console and a file (`app.log`). You can adjust the logging level and format in the `logging_config.py` file.

### Models

- **Transcription Model**: The default transcription model is `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo`. You can change this by modifying the `model_name` parameter in the `WhisperAudioTranscriber` initialization.
- **Diarization Model**: The default diarization model is `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`. You can change this by modifying the model loading code in the `PyannoteDiarizer` class.
